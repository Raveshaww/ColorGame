# ColorGame
A simple game that displays a RGB value and three or six differently colored squares, depending on the difficulty that they select. In order to win, the player must choose the square that matches the RGB value.

This project was a learning exercise when I was first trying to learn JavaScript somtime in 2017 while following along with Colt Steele's "Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy.
# Usage
In order to play, simply download the files and make sure that they are in the same folder. Click on the ColorGame.html file and the game will launch in your browser. Guess the right color and you win!
